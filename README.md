========================

documentation: http://pkg-build.racket-lang.org/doc/measures-with-dimensions/index.html

This repository is a racket package that provides structs to represent measures,
units, and dimensions, and functions and macros to manipulate these.

It was originally inspired by [Metaxal/measures](https://github.com/Metaxal/measures),
but is more based on the concept of dimensions, and it also has types for
[typed/racket](http://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/index.html).
